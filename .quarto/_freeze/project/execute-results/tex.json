In order to do that we are going to model the ice velocity in a 2D cross section represented by the PDE called First order model. These equations are non-linear as the viscosity depends on horizontal velocity(@eq-5) making it an non- Newtonian fluid, represented as follows: \n\n> FO model: \n\n$$\n2\\partial_x(\\eta\\partial_x u_x)+\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_z(\\eta\\partial_z u_x)=\\rho g\\partial_x h\n$$ {#eq-main}\n\n\n\n$$\n\\partial_x u_z = - \\partial_x u_x\n$${#eq-2}\n\n\n$$\n\\partial_t h + u_x|_{z=s} \\partial_x h = u_z\n$${#eq-3}\n\n> Boundary Conditions:\n\n>> At the bed surface(Dirichlet's): $u_x=0$\n\n>> At the ice/atmosphere interface(Neumann):\n\n\n$$\n\\eta(2\\partial_{x} u_x \\partial_{x} h -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{z}  u_x) =  0\n$${#eq-8}\n\n\n> Viscosity dependence on horizontal velocity:\n\n\n$$\n\\eta= A^{-1/3} \\left( (\\partial_xu_x)^2+\\frac{1}{4}(\\partial_zu_x)^2\\right)^{-1/3}\n$${#eq-5}\n\n\n\n\\pagebreak \n\n\n\n\n### 1. Order of equation :\n\nThe @eq-main, is **second order** for horizontal velocity.\n\n### 2. Type of equation :\n\nFor constant viscosity($\\eta$), the PDE for horizontal velocity @eq-main can be written as,\n\n$$\n\\eta(2\\partial_{xx} +\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{zz} ) u_x =  \\rho g\\partial_x h\n$$\n\nWhen we put values in the discriminat($B^2-4AC$), we get it as  negative since the term representing the coefficient B is absent and A, C both are positive, suggesting that its an **elliptic** PDE of second order. \n\n### 3. FEM formulism : \n\nTo solve @eq-main using FEM, we first need to convert this PDE into weak(Variational) form. For that, we define a function space $V_h$ over our mesh $\\Omega$. In this function space we find $u_x \\in V_h$ such that $u_x=0$ on the bed(Homogeneous Dirichlet BC). \n\n$$\nV_h = \\{ v \\in H^1(\\Omega) : u|_{\\Gamma_{bed}} = 0 \\}\n$$\n\n\nThe weak form to find $u \\in V_h$ for all $v \\in V_h$ has , \n\n> the bilinear form \n\n\n$$a(u, v) = \\int_{\\Omega} \\left( 2\\eta \\partial_x u \\partial_x v + \\frac{1}{2}\\eta \\partial_z u \\partial_z v \\right) \\, d\\Omega$${#eq-6}\n\n\n\n> and the linear form,\n\n\n$$\nL(v) = -\\int_{\\Omega} \\rho g \\partial_x h v \\, d\\Omega \n$${#eq-7}\n\n\nThe boundary condition:\n\n\n> At the bed surface($\\Gamma_{bed}$): $u_x=0$\n\n> At the ice/atmosphere interface($\\Gamma_{surface}$):\n\n\n\n$$\n\\eta(2\\partial_{x} v_x \\partial_{x} h -\\frac{1}{2}\\partial_{z}  v_x) =  0\n$${#eq-8}\n\nThe set of equations @eq-6, @eq-7, @eq-8 represent the well posed and complete problem which can be solved linearly in FeniCS. \n\n### 4. Linear version of @eq-main\n\nTo achieve linearity, we have set the viscosity as 1. \n\n\n\n",
